This is the working directory for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project'


tips from forum:

There are many ways to do this:
dplyr package using the group_by() and the summarize_each() functions
ddply() function from the plyr package
aggregate()
melt() and dcast() from the reshape2 package
tapply or lapply may also work but are harder to implement than any of the above, IMHO.
