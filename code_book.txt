Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data
Student: antonioprol
==================================================================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'code_book.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R': R-script code

- 'tidydata.txt': the final tidy data set of the Course Project

For information on subfolder 'UCI HAR Dataset' files see:

- 'UCI HAR Dataset/Readme.txt'

For each grouped record (row) the data in 'tidydata.txt' has four columns:
==================================================================

- "activity": with the descriptive activity name

- "subject_id": with the volunteer identifier

- "variable": a feature variable name

- "mean": the corresponding mean for the grouped values determined by the three previous columns

More detailed information about features in:

- 'UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt'

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
